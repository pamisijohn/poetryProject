ODE TO BARCELONA FC

How blessed is the club, who leads a humble life
With training and practices, shun all pitch rage
Unvex'd with anxious cares, and void of strife
Noble victories we indelibly inprint on history's page
And when our strenght fails, boldness be our title of honour
With never flinching labour, victories we've won and will win
Telnim un nom el sap tothom: Barca! Barca!
Players, Supporters, united we are strong
Mes que un club, this we never say in vain
Hail the all-time victors! hail Barcelona FC! hail Barca!
